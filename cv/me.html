<div class="well">

<p>
I am an American engineer with a passion for developing thoughtfully and creatively considered robotic, mechanical and software systems with great interest in soft robotics and human-robot interaction. I have international experience working and researching on diverse teams in both academia and industry.
</p>

<p>
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Drexel University. As a former student of Dr. Paul Oh, I have been working and researching in robotics since the outset of my university career.

<p>
﻿While still in school, I spent seven months in South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studying the manufacture and construction of their humanoid robot, HUBO. ﻿After graduating, I spent two more years in Korea as an engineer at SimLab in South Korea, where I developed and marketed hardware and software tools for robotics research. While in Korea, I also got the chance to work with a professional production company to develop artists' software tools for animating complex and constrained robot motions. 
</p>

<p>
Now a Research Associate at Disney Research in Pittsburgh, PA, I have been focusing on the design and manufacturing of soft, sensing robotic systems.
