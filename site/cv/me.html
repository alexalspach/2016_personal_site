<div class="well">


<p>
I am a research engineer with a passion for developing thoughtfully and creatively considered robotic systems with great interest in soft robotics and human-robot interaction. I have international experience working and researching on diverse teams in both academia and industry.
</p>

<p>
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and have been working and researching in robotics since the outset of my university career.
</p>

<p>
While in school, I spent seven months in South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studying the manufacture and construction of their <a href="#HumanoidRobotCollaborativeDocumentation2" style="text-decoration:underline">humanoid robot, HUBO</a>. After graduating, I spent two more years in Korea as an engineer at SimLab in Seoul, where I developed and marketed hardware and software <a href="#AllegroHand" style="text-decoration:underline">tools for robotics research</a>. While there, I also got the chance to work with a professional production company to develop <a href="#ActiveStudio" style="text-decoration:underline">artists' software tools</a> for animating complex, constrained and synchronized robot motions. After that, I developed <a href="#SoftUpper" style="text-decoration:underline">soft "huggable" robots</a> and various <a href="#SnapBot1" style="text-decoration:underline">other robotic systems</a> at Disney Research in Pittsburgh.
</p>

<p>
Now a manager at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) in Cambridge, MA, I run a small team called the "Tactile Team" exploring the fabrication, perception and control of <a href="https://youtu.be/WNXSAK6pF0M" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">soft, sensing robotic systems</a> for human-robot interaction and dexterous, contact-rich whole-body manipulation.
