<div class="well">


<p>
I am a research engineer with a passion for developing thoughtfully and creatively considered robotic systems with great interest in soft robotics and human-robot interaction. I have international experience working and researching on diverse teams in both academia and industry.
</p>

<p>
I hold Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Drexel University and have been working and researching in robotics since the outset of my university career.
</p>

<p>
﻿While in school, I spent seven months in South Korea’s Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) studying the manufacture and construction of their humanoid robot, HUBO. ﻿After graduating, I spent two more years in Korea as an engineer at SimLab in Seoul, where I developed and marketed hardware and software tools for robotics research. While there, I also got the chance to work with a professional production company to develop artists' software tools for animating complex, constrained and synchronized robot motions. After that, I developed soft "huggable" robots and various other robotic systems at Disney Research in Pittsburgh.
</p>

<p>
Now a manager at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) in Cambridge, MA, I run a small team called the "Tactile Team" exploring the fabrication, perception and control of soft, sensing robotic systems for human-robot interaction and dexterous, contact-rich whole-body manipulation.
